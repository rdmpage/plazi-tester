# Plazi tester

The goal of this project is to understand how accurately [Plazi](http://plazi.org) is marking up material citations in documents. The site takes a Plazi treatment in XML form displays the XML as a marked up web page. In other words, it displays the tags assigned to the text by Plazi. These tags are colour-coded, and there is a tooltip to show the corresponding tag name. 

To use the web site simply paste in the Plazi treatment id (typically a UUID) and the site will display the marked up document.
